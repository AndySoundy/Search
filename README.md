# README #

This project is a simple and fast command line tool that allows the user to search for file names, file types, and text strings within the files.

## Things to do ##
* Implement text find and replace option.
* Implement a more equitable division of the workload than just what directories happen to be in the top branch.
* Add compiled executable for Windows users without Python already installed.
